        <h3>History:</h3>
<p>In the quaint village of Vahalu, nestled in the district of Bharuch, a small but ambitious endeavor began in 1996.
Shikshan Jagruti Abhiyaan was established by Mr. Majid sir, Mr. Ahmad sir, Mr. Siraj Musa sir, Mr. Usman sir, 
Mr. Aziz sir, Mr. Mustak sir [late], Mr. Daud sir and many more dedicated educators with a passion for nurturing
young minds. The vision was simple yet profound: to provide high-quality academic support and empower students to 
achieve their full potential.</p>
<p>For nearly more than one decade, Shikshan Jagruti Abhiyaan flourished, becoming a cornerstone of academic excellence in the
community. The dedicated team of tutors and staff left an indelible mark on countless students' lives.
Shikshan Jagruti Abhiyaan became synonymous with academic success, offering a wide range of subjects and preparing
students for college, university entrance exams, and standardized tests. This was all possible with the financial 
and virtual support of foreigners. 
However, in 2008, unforeseen circumstances forced Shikshan Jagruti Abhiyaan to temporarily cease operations.
Financial difficulties, created a hiatus in the journey of this educational institution.</p>

<h3>Rebirth in 2015:</h3>
<p>In 2015, a collective determination and unwavering community support brought Shikshan Jagruti Abhiyaan back to life.
A group of former students, now successful professionals in various fields, the financial support of foreigners and
with the guidance of teachers who started the abhiyaan before, joined hands to revive the institution that had played
 a pivotal role in their lives. This group included Dr. Suhel Vaza, Safwan sir, Muntajeer sir and many more. 
With renewed energy and commitment, Shikshan Jagruti Abhiyaan reopened its doors, bringing together a team of 
experienced educators, innovative teaching methodologies, and state-of-the-art facilities. The relaunch was marked
 by a rededication to the original vision: empowering students to reach new heights academically and personally.</p>
